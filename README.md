# Wordle Shqip

A Wordle-inspired game tailored for Albanian language lovers — but not a straight clone.  
I fixed what annoyed me in the original:  

- Words can be up to **9 letters** long.  
- Each word comes with a **description/hint** to help you guess.  

This isn’t Wordle. It’s Wordle *done better* for Shqip.

## Built With

- **HTML5** — clean, semantic markup  
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling via CLI  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — no frameworks, pure JS  

## How to Play

Guess the hidden word using the hints and letter feedback. Words vary in length, so stay sharp.

## Setup / Run

Just open `index.html` in your browser. No server or install needed.

## Why This?

Because I wanted a Wordle that respects Albanian words and gives you a bit more challenge and context.
